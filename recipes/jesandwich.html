                <li>4 hard boiled eggs</li>
                <li>6 white bread pan</li>
                <li>3 tbsp of Kewpie mayonnaise</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer your peeled eggs in a bowl and mash it with a fork. Note: make sure to mash the egg whites into small, same-size pieces.</li>
                <li>Add the sugar, salt, mayonnaise and milk all at once then mix until well combined.</li>
                <li>Now that you have your egg mixture, let’s assemble.</li>
                <li>Grab your bread and spread the butter on one side. Do this on all of the bread.</li>
                <li>Spread your egg mixture evenly on the buttered side of the bread.</li>
                <li>Put the other side of bread on top and push gently until it flattens.</li>
                <li>This next step is optional. With a knife, cut all sides of crusts off the bread.</li>
                <li>And lastly, cut the bread in half then serve.</li>
            </ol>
